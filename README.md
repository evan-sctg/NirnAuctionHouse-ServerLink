###Statements from ESO Devs

CoD (Cash on Delivery) is an option in the The Elder Scrolls Online's mail system. By using this, you can send an item and ensure that you will receive gold in exchange via mail. You must attach an item to the mail, and you can set a gold amount desired. The receiving player will then have to pay the specified gold amount to be able to detach the sent item.

When CoD is selected, the only gold that should be removed from your bank is the applied postage, which is calculated based on the attachments and the size of the selected CoD. Once the recipient chooses to accept the mail, you will receive the CoD amount. If the recipient refuses, you will receive the mail back along with the attachment, but you will not be able to reclaim the postage amount.
